I just finished my computer science final, which is a game written in C++ with the Allegro library. It's sort of crappy, but you can download it here if you want to try it out. It's sort of inspired by games like the Jumper series, which frustrate you an awful lot, but not quite enough so that you don't lose interest. I hope to accomplish something similar.

Some things to note about it:
<ol>
<li>It's a beta version made for this class and the deadline the project has. I will most likely continue to work on this, so feedback is welcome.</li>
<li>Some features exist pretty much only so it fits with the rubric that it's being graded with. For instance, high scores and save files are saved to an unencrypted text file, which is incredibly easily editable. In the final version, either the local copies will be harder to edit, or the high scores will be stored on a server.</li>
<li>The music is definitely not final. It's just that the game needed sound to get full marks, so I quickly threw on a soundtrack I had lying around. It doesn't exactly fit.</li>
<li>The boss is really only there because we needed to have nested structs/classes for something and a boss made up of a bunch of particles is the only thing I could come up with in time. He may or may not stay for the final version, but if he does, his levels won't be the last ones (there's more to come.)</li></ol>
