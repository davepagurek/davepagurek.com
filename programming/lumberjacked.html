Made for the Newgrounds Game Jam 8! The theme was "Cabin in the Woods" and then we had 48 hours to make a game. This is what we came up with.

I programmed it, and BPremo and Brewster (on Newgrounds) did the art and animation.

Also pathfinding algorithms are hard, so this has what I call a "bounce off of stuff" algorithm.
