In case you're wondering, Snowball Fight 1 is completely different and is in the games section. But trust me, version 2 is much more awesome :D

Anyway, I made this for my sister as a christmas present. I haven't had much time for bug testing, so if you notice anything going wrong, tell me about what happened/what you were doing to make it happen. Like, post a comment or something. So I can make the game better :3

Also, if anything goes REALLY wrong with the game, you can always reload the web page. The game automatically saves your progress so you don't have to worry about losing any of that.
