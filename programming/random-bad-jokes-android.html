Get jokes from a user-created database of the best bad jokes!

This was my attempt at learning basic Android development. It is a native Android (lollipop) client for my Random Bad Jokes website. It is nearly full-featured and features a UI inspired by the original site but adapted to fit Android UI guidelines.

<ul>
	<li>View random jokes</li>
	<li>Share jokes</li>
	<li>Flag as inappropriate/spam</li>
	<li>Add jokes</li>
</ul>
