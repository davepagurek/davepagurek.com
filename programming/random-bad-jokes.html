<p>Those who know me personally know that I love bad jokes to a fault.</p>
<p>Given a free weekend in the summer, I figured I should probably take the time to do some more web programming. The last webapp I made, <a href="http://www.davepagurek.com/apps/coolstory/">CoolStory</a>, was made entirely in Javascript, so there was no backend at all. I wanted to do make something with a database, so a random bad joke site seemed like the logical conclusion.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<div class="half left"><div class="padding">
<h3>Random Bad Jokes</h3>
<p>Reloading the website takes you to a new bad joke randomly selected from the database. Pressing the "Random Joke" button uses AJAX to load in the next joke to minimize requests.</p>
<h3>Spam Flagging</h3>
<p>Pressing the "Flag as Inappropriate" button marks a joke as being spam, offensive, or not actually a joke. If a joke is flagged by enough people, it will be automatically deleted.</p>
<h3>Joke Submission</h3>
<p>People can easily submit their own bad jokes to the site without having to create an account. A maximum amount of jokes added per day is imposed per IP address to help prevent spam.</p>
<h3>Edit Your Jokes</h3>
<p>There is a page showing every joke that has been submitted by your IP address. You are given the option to update your jokes.</p>
<h3>Fully Responsive</h3>
<p>The site has been built responsively and therefore works normally even on mobile devices.</p>
