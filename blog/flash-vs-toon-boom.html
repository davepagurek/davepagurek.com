At Glashan we have available two programs for animation: Toon Boom Studio and Flash MX. I’m going to compare these two programs (and also their newer versions which, sadly, we do not have at school) and see which is, overall, the best for 2D animation.

<h2>Price</h2>

Flash, or at least Flash 8 and lower, was made by Macromedia. It is now owned by Adobe. Flash is made for much more than just animation, which is really why, today, Flash CS4 goes for about US$700.

Toon Boom Studio is Toon Boom Animation’s hobbyist-level animation software, and it can be purchased for US$300. As far as budget goes, Toon Boom is the way to go if you don’t have to worry about exporting your video for web (because Flash won that battle long ago, with preloaders, actionscript and YouTube.) However, Toon Boom Animate (the professional-level software) goes for US$2000, so there is a range in proce for Toon Boom products. But at school we don’t really need to worry about price because the stuff’s already been bought, so let’s move on.

WINNER FOR PRICE: Toon Boom.

<h2>Cut-out Animation</h2>

Cut-out animation is a technique where, instead of redrawing each frame, you simply move around static elements of what is essentially a 2D puppet. Examples of this, if you don’t know what I’m talking about, would be Homestar Runner or Tank Men.
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>


Flash’s approach to this involved making each separate part a “symbol.” Now, in Flash MX up to CS3, each piece is its own separate thing from the puppet as a whole. They do not naturally stick together in certain areas like they do with Flash CS4’s “bones” tool (seen to the above.) Instead, one must manually adjust the pivot point so they all stick together. This is not very intuitive and it often makes the cut-out method seem like too much work. CS4’s bones is a form of inverse-kinematics which helps make the puppet work like you would think a puppet would (the feature is called “bones” for a reason) and helps a lot with the process. But what all versions of Flash lacks is a way to change the shape of your puppet during movement. For example, if you wanted to change the shape of a character’s hand, you would have to actually make a new layer with a new puppet with the new hand shape and pick up where the old layer left off. This is reeeally inconvenient, and is a major downside of Flash.

Toon Boom Studio is a lot like Flash MX’s system with the exception that instead of moving an object, it is more like you re-draw any changes you want to happen first, and then you can move around the whole timeline. This way, it is MUCH easier to change a hand shape (to use my previous example.) However, in Studio, there is no inverse kinematics, so you have to change the rotate point etc. Only in Animate do they have a feature that is much like Flash’s “bones” where it makes an actual puppet. Though, it is superior to bones because it still has the ability to change the drawings being moved very easily.

THE WINNER FOR THIS TECHNIQUE: Toon Boom.

<h2>Frame-By-Frame</h2>

Good old classic animation where the only movement comes from many of the artist’s drawings being played back quickly, no computer algorithms involved in the motion of the objects. Toon Boom has a good system going where your brush tool draws sexy, well-rendered lines, and you can even rotate the canvas so you can draw better. Although Toon Boom Studio’s drawing tools are superior to those in Flash, occasionally there are glitches in the fill bucket where you have to zoom in a lot so that the auto-close gaps function doesn’t prevent the tool from working. Also, it really is a pain doing repetitive things like Insert &gt; New Cell and then Reselecting whatever you’re working on….. Well, basically, I grew up using Flash, so I’m pretty biased against other methods of framebyframing.

But Flash… oh god, the drawing tools are terrible! The ink blots you get when you’re drawing and you left the “Autocorrect” feature on (and in Flash MX, it’s impossible to turn it off!) But because of a relatively simple way to mass-insert keyframes and another equally simple way to use keyboard shortcuts while animating, I think Flash is better for the actual process of the frame-by-framing. But because of Flash’s crappy drawing tools, I deduce:

THE WINNER: It’s a tie.

<h2>Postproduction</h2>

We all like to add little effects to our movies once the basic animation is done. In Flash 8 or higher (and hopefully we’ll be getting Flash 8 at school if my little Windows “hack” works ) you have the option to add blurs, glows, bevels, drop-shadows and more from within Flash. Even when used sparingly, these little finishing touches can make an animation much better. And because it can now be done from within Flash, it’s one less thing that needs to be done (rather than exporting/importinf from Gimp or Photoshop…. ughh.)

Toon Boom Studio has no filter support (although its $2000 counterpart, Toon Boom Animate, does.) What Studio has to compensate is a neat little feature called the 2.5D camera. It places the various two-dimensional layers on a 3D axis so that when, say, the camera zooms in, the various elements move at different speeds depending on how close the camera is to them, which creates the illusion of depth (hence, two-and-a-half-dimensional.) Toon Boom also comes with an auto-lip synch feature, but although I can see how this would be useful if perfected it doesn’t always get the mouth movements right, and it looks much better when done manually.

THE WINNER: Flash.

<h2>Exporting</h2>

So, you’ve made your movie. Now what? All versions of Flash come with one form or another of ActionScript. This allows for FLV playback (basically what YouTube runs on), or simply adding preloaders to your content so you can display vector animations on your website (like what I do.) Flash also exports great QuickTime movies as well as AVIs (but there’s ome odd glitch in the AVI export, so you end up with these odd green lines sometimes.)

Toon Boom exports in QuickTime and AVI efficiently, so if that’s all you need, then you’re good to go. But if you want to export web video, you really are dependent on Flash. You can upload the SWF that Toon Boom gives you to your website, but performance will be compromised because Toon Boom doesn’t offer to make preloaders. This means that your content loads as it plays, which can lead to horrible video quality on slower connections. Alternatively, you could upload an AVI or something to a website like YouTube or my personal favourite video hosting site, Vimeo and then embed that on your site. However, though Vimeo and YouTube offer HD video streaming now, you still can’t beat Flash’s vector, as it looks better and has a very small file size.

THE WINNER: Flash.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Well, it looks like in my review Flash and Toon Boom came out equal. But really, if you’re into web stuff, go with Flash. If not, Toon Boom is the way to go. OR if you’re on a budget and are fine with using Vimeo or YouTube, go with Toon Boom because it is a great piece of software for a low price. Personally though, I’m going to stick with Flash because of its ActionScript. But that has nothing to do with the actual animation really, so the choice is that of you, the end user.
