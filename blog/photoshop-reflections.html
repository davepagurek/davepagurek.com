On the web these days, as well as in print advertisements, illustrations and just about everywhere else, people take advantage of a very modern-looking effect that can be accomplished in Photoshop. The reflection effect can add depth to a picture, and make something look more <em>full.</em>

Here's what we'll be making:

Okay, on with the tutorial!"]<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-715" title="final" src="http://www.davepagurek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/final-300x145.jpg" alt="The final product." width="300" height="145" />[/caption]
<h2>1. Set up your picture</h2>
You have to have an image.Â  It looks much better if your object has no "box" around it (i.e. you drew it in a transparent photoshop layer) rather than using a full photograph. However, a photo works too, and can produce eye-pleasing effects as well.

First, you have to make sure your drawing is on one layer. If you already have an image, you don't need to worry about this. If not, back up your multi-layer file, and then go to <strong>Layer &gt; Merge Down </strong>until you have your drawing layer and a background. Make sure your drawing's background is still transparent.

Now, go to <strong>Image &gt; Canvas Size</strong> and double the document's height. Then, depending on what program you use, you will have the option to select where the new part of the canvas is added to the bottom of the current document.

<h2>2. Make the reflection</h2>
In your drawing layer, select everything and go to <strong>Edit &gt; Copy. </strong>Now, go to <strong>Edit &gt; Paste </strong>and it should be added into a new layer. In the layers palette, click and drag the pasted layer until it is underneath the original but still above the background (if you even have a background layer.) Use the <strong>transform tool</strong>, and make sure the "show transform controls" checkbox is selected. Click on your drawing to select him. Now, click on one of the vertical dots on your selection and drag it the other way until the image flips. Click and drag your drawing until the bottom and top of the drawings meet.

<h2>3. Make it fade out</h2>
Apply a <a href="http://www.davepagurek.com/2010/photoshop-masks/">layer mask</a> to the upside-down drawing (if you don't know how to apply layer masks, <a href="http://www.davepagurek.com/2010/photoshop-masks/">read this article.</a>) Make the layer mask a gradient from a medium-grey to black by selecting the gradient tool, maing the grey your foreground colour and black the background colour, and clicking and dragging down on your canvas.

<h2>4. Add the shadow</h2>
If you did this using a picture, you may choose to skip this step. However, should you be using an object, a shadow really ties everything together nicely. Here's how to do so: Create a new layer (<strong>Layer &gt; New Layer</strong>) in between your object and its shadow. Use the circular selection tool, or <strong>"Elliptical Marquee Tool"</strong>, and select an oval in between the points where they meet. Fill it with a dark grey colour. Deselect it (<strong>Select &gt; Deselect</strong>). Now, go to <strong>Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur</strong> and put the blur radius to about 8 pixels.

<h2>5. The final product</h2>
Here it is!
