<p>My post for this week is a Photoshop tutorial! Haven't done any of those yet, so here goes!</p>
<p>So, here's a before/after of what we're going to be making:</p>
<p><img title="original" src="http://www.davepagurek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/original-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><img title="end" src="http://www.davepagurek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/end-300x225.jpg" alt="The final product." width="300" height="225" /></p>

<h2>1. Preparing the photo</h2>
<p>Find a photo that you think would like to make old-style. Open it up with Photoshop, Gimp, or a similar program.</p>
<p>Now, go to Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur. Change it so that it only blurs two or three pixels, so that you can still see what's going on, but things look ever so slightly in soft focus.</p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Adjustment Layer </strong>icon in the layers panel and select "Hue/Saturation." In GIMP, a similar menu can be accessed by going to Colors &gt; Colorize.</p>

<dd>There's the button shown in PhotoShop Elements 3.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>In the dialogue window that pops up, bring the Hue slider all the way to the left. Bring the saturation slider almost all the way to the left, but leave a bit of room so that there is still a reddish feel to the photo.</p>

<dd>Notice the positions of the sliders!</dd>

<h2>2. Giving it the "old" effect</h2>
<p>Create a new layer, and fill it with a solid orange colour. Change the display effect in the layer panel from "Normal" to "Color Dodge". Change the Opacity to something like 80. This should make the image seem a bit washed out and have that really old photo sort of orange haze.</p>

<dl id="attachment_659">

<dd>Notice the "Color Dodge" and opacity levels!</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Now, create a new layer (Layer &gt; New Layer). Fill it completely white. Go to Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Add noise. Mess around with the settings until you have an evenly spaced array of speckles (non-black and white would look better.) Change that layer's display effect to "Linear Burn" and make its opacity about 50%.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_660">
<dt><img title="noise" src="http://www.davepagurek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/noise.jpeg" alt="Noise dialogue window and layer settings." width="577" height="411" /></dt>
<dd>Take a look at the settings I used for the Noise filter and for the layer settings.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Now, make yet another layer. Before you do anything to it, change your two colours so that you have a light beige and a dark beige. <img title="colors" src="http://www.davepagurek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/colors.jpeg" alt="" width="100" height="118" /> Go to Filter &gt; Render &gt; Clouds. Now, the layer should appear to be a slightly fake looking parchment. To apply this effect onto the rest of the image, change the layer's display properties to "Color." Now the rest of the image should look as washed out and old as before, but looking a little brown (which is what usually happens to old photos over time.)</p>
<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>Before we continue, you have to go to Layer &gt; Flatten Image. This ensures that our next filter will edit everything and not just one layer.</p>
<p>Go to Filter &gt; Render &gt; Lighting Effects. Now, I'll describe exactly what I did, or you can copy the settings I used from the screenshot. Either way, here it is.</p>
<p>Firstly, I changed the "spotlight" to a "flaslight" from the dropdown ment. Then, by clicking and dragging one of the four squares along the edge of the circle, I expanded the light so that it covered more area. I also changed the "intensity" to about 70%.</p>

<dd>Make sure your settings look like the ones I used here!</dd>
