So. You're in Flash. You have a variable that increases by one each frame, acting as a timer. You want Flash to do something, let's say, every thirty frames. How would you do that?

Well, do you remember in, like, grade three when they were first teaching you long division? I remember that, when one number doesn't divide equally into another, we would get the "remainder" rather than the decimals. In case you don't know what I'm talking about, the remainder is what is "left over" when you divide two natural numbers. For instance, if I had 30 apples and five baskets, and I wanted to evenly distribute the apples between, the baskets, I would have six in each one (because 30/5=6.) But what if you have 31 apples? Because you have to have the exact same number of apples in each basket, you can't do anything with one of your apples. That is because 31/5=6 r1 (6, with a remainder of one.)

So how does this have to do with Flash? Well, going back to the original scenario: Would you agree that every thirty frames, the timer's number is divisible by 30? If the timer's number is 30<em>x</em>, then it can always be divided by thirty evenly. However, in between the intervals of thirty, the number will not be evenly divisible by 30. Instead, it will give you a remainder. So, to see if the timer's number is at the next interval of thirty, you just have to check if the timer, when divided by thirty, has a remainder or not. If it doesn't, then that means that the number is divisible by thirty and is therefor the time when you want Flash to execute the command you wanted.

Here is the sample Actionscript 2 code to show you how to, every thirty frames, output "Hello, world!"
<code lang="actionscript">
var timer:Number = 0;
onEnterFrame = function () {
	if (timer%30==0) {
		trace("Hello, world!");
	}
	timer++;
};
</code>

So how does this work? Well, just like in Flash you can have an if statement checking if, say, a variable plus 5 is equal to four:
<code lang="actionscript">if (timer+5==4) {</code>

Likewise, you can substitute the addition sign with the % sign to check for a remainder. What it does is it outputs ONLY the remainder, and not the rest of the number. For instance:
<code lang="actionscript">
trace(8%2); //Outputs 0
trace(44%3); //Outputs 2
trace(31%5); //Outputs 1
</code>

If you're looking for a practical use for this, I found one to use in the game I'm currently developing. In it, you pick up various weapons, and click and hold to shoot them. But unless you have a machine gun or some other rapid-fire weapon, you don't want a new bullet to come out every frame. You might instead want a new bullet to come out every fifth frame or something of the like. So, I used this code, assuming there's already a function called shootWeapon():
<code lang="actionscript">
var mouseDown:Number = 0;
onMouseDown = function () {
	mouseDown = 1;
}
onMouseUp = function () {
	mouseDown = 0;
}
onEnterFrame = function () {
	if (mouseDown>0) {
		mouseDown++;
		if (mouseDown%5 == 0) {
			shootWeapon();
		}
	} 
}</code>

Anyway, hopefully you can find a practical use for this in your next Flash project!
&lt;/david&gt;
