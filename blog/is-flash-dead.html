For those who are too lazy to read the rest of my post, I would say that Flash is not dead. Yet. But I think it is on the decline, and soon will not be as important on the web as it currently is.
<h2>1. Flash for streaming videos: I blame Steve.</h2>
Why is this all happening? Wasn't it just a few years ago that Flash was declared the victor of the online video battle? Well, the first sign that Flash was really going anywhere for online markets was because of YouTube. YouTube, notorious for crappy viral videos but also the website that provides an outlet for any web-based filmmakers, was one of the first websites to really take advantage of Flash's streaming video capabilities and the FLV video format. Anyone could play their videos, regardless of operating system (granted, you still need to get the Flash plugin). The rest of the web followed YouTube's lead, and soon enough Flash became the industry standard.

Then came the iPhone, and Mr. Steve Jobs decided that Flash didn't need to be on the iPhone because there is already a YouTube app which was not Flash-dependent. For the first few years of the iPhone's life, this made everyone really pissed off at Steve Jobs, because no one could really understand his reasoning. And in the beginning of 2010, with the release of the iPad (also Flash-less), when Jobs explained his thinking, still many people disagreed. But no one can really argue with Apple, so Flash is probably never going to work on Apple's mobile market.

The whole mobile-market thing is another issue. Because so much of mobile web users rely on Apple's mobile version of Safari, there's no real point to try to develop anything mobile-related for Flash. Because YouTube, who really was the one to make Flash a standard, was phasing out Flash for mobile markets, the rest of the industry began to follow suit. The one point that Steve Jobs raised in his rant about Adobe that actually made a bit of sense was his line about HTML5 players. Safari, being a webkit-based browser, does not need Flash to play videos. Steve Jobs was trying to push forward development of a new system which, all in all, will be even more open than Flash was, and will be even more wide-spread in terms of availability. Of course, any decent HTML5 developer will still use a Flash video player as a fallback, because at the moment only the newest of some web browsers support HTML5, and there is still a large population that would not be able to see an HTML5 player. Using a Flash player if there is no HTML5 support is a good idea still because 98% of web users have the Flash Player pluugin installed, so this makes pretty sure that your viewers will be able to see your videos.
<h2>2. Flash for an animation program: Ditch Flash.</h2>
Though websites like <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a> still flourish, I think that using Flash Player to display animations will be on the decline as well. As I mentioned earlier, Flash Player does not work on Apple's mobile devices, and people want to do what they can to use an alternative method because watching movies on these things is, simple, <em>really cool.</em>

<em> </em>Because Flash lets you export .mov or .avi files, it is incredibly easy to use a tool like YouTube or similar services to provide HTML5 playback so that you can watch your animation programs on multiple platforms, so there is no need to use Flash Player here. But <a href="http://www.davepagurek.com/2010/flash-vs-toon-boom/">Flash is not the only program that can be used for animation.</a> If you are not using Flash player, and there are other programs that can be cheaper and better than Flash, why bother using it? This is, of course, assuming you are not a programmer, which I will explain more later. I have found that exporting videos from Flash is the most agonizingly annoying process that any animator can ever go through. Seriously, people, Flash drops so many frames in Quicktime exports that it's not funny. Only a few times have I been able to export .avi videos that did not have weird glitchy pixelated parts where the exporter messed up. On the other hand, I have had no problems whatsoever with Toon Boom, so I have been using that recently (Toon Boom can also export .swf's, so eve if you want your movies to be on Newgrounds, Toon Boom is, I would say, the way to go.)
<h2>3. Flash for Online Games: Flash is still the best.</h2>
Hands down, Flash has won this battle and will continue to do so. Though you can play your silly free apps from the App Store all you want, they barely ever come close to the quality and care that has been put into games on websites like Newgrounds or Kongregate. Flash is really easy to use if you want to program a game that both works well and looks awesome. And to show how awesome Flash gaming really is, for a while Adobe even made is possible to export iPhone/iPad apps from Flash! However, Apple then went ahead and blocked this for no legitimate reason, which further proves how jealous Apple really is of Adobe and how badly Apple wants a monopoly in the market for their own devices.

Put simply, although Apple keeps telling consumers how great of a gaming device their products are, they will never be superior to the almighty Flash game. If I were to buy a smart phone with the intention of playing games on it, I would have to go with a Google Android phone because of its support for Flash games. Though people will try as hard as they can to switch to other means of displaying multimedia on the web, Flash is irreplaceable in the gaming market.
<h2>4. What should you do?</h2>
Well, I have drawn some conclusions from the whole Flash debate, even though I may not like them. I am willing to take off almost all of my Flash content from my website in the near future. As soon as Vimeo, my favourite video hosting service, enables embedding of its HTML5 player, I'm going to make all my videos come from Vimeo. I've always wanted to have play/pause controls anyway, so it's about time I get around to doing it.

As for my Flash carousel on the main page of my website (that slideshow-like thing), it will stay as Flash, because it just so happens that my Flash file is smaller than what it would be if I used images and the Jquery language. However, for those non-flash browsers (basically, mobile Apple products and people who didn't know to download Flash player) it displays, instead of the player, a static image of the first (and usually the most important) slide which is linked to that page.

And, finally, for my games. They're still Flash, and always will be. It's not like you would be able to play them on an iPhone anyway because you have no keyboard to use. So they're here to stay.

I'm in a sort of love/hate relationship with Flash, so I can't say outright whether or not I support it. I've seen plenty of awesome Flash movies/games/websites, but I don't like Flash's lack of compatibility. But I guess that's Steve's fault for influencing the industry so much. Or maybe it was bound to happen. Either way, I've got a lot of work to do on my website.

&lt;/david&gt;
