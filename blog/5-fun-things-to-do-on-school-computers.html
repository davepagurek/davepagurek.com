<p>I know it's been a while, but I'm reinstating my weekly blog post policy. This week will be about something I've wanted to write about for a while: School computers! They're just too easy to hack and do fun stuff with, especially because teachers are just so incompetent with technology sometimes. Anyway, tome for the top five!</p>
<p></p>
<h2>1. Be a Javascript Troll</h2>
There's all kinds of really annoying things you can do with Javascript, and all you need in order to do some of these things is a text editor and a web browser. So, for this script, open up Notepad or something of the like and type the following:

<code lang="html"><html>
<head>
<title>Lol i troll u</title>
<script type="text/javascript">
	function troll() {
		alert('Lol i troll u!');
		troll();
	}
</script>
</head>
<body onLoad="troll()">
<center>
<img src="http://www.davepagurek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TrollFace1.gif" />
</center>
</body>
</html>
</code>
<p>So what do you do with this code? Save it as <strong>troll.html</strong> or anything else as long as it ends with .html and not .txt. Copy it onto someone else's computer when they're not looking (i.e. put it on a USB stick and open it up from there.) Then, quickly leave the viscinity before they look back.</p>
<p>So, what does this code do? Basically, it creates a function called <strong>troll()</strong> which makes a popup and then does troll() again, and that new troll() makes a popup and calls troll(), and that new troll makes a popup that calls troll()..... It's a never-ending circle. Once you click "ok", a new alert pops up. The only way out is to force-quit the web browser (open up the Task Manager and end a process for Windows, or just force-quit normally for Mac.) As an added bonus, the page has the trollface as a background.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>2. Crash a Computer using Flash and Google</h2>
<p>Yep, it's actually quite easy to do. Open up a new flash document. Open up the Actions panel for the stage of the first frame. If it's in Actionscript 2, write the following:</p>
<code lang="actionscript">onEnterFrame = function () {
	getURL("http://www.google.com", "_blank");
}</code>
Or if it's actionscript 3 write the following:
<code lang="actionscript">function openGoogle(e:Event):void {
	navigateToURL("http://www.google.com", "_blank");
}
stage.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, openGoogle);</code>
<p>Press Control-Enter when you're ready to crash your computer. What this does is repeatedly open up new tabs of Google. But it opens so many Google tabs every second that after maybe 20-30 seconds your computer will barely be able to respond to you mouse clicks or even mouse movements. Usually, any attempt to stop it will result in  processing overload and cause the computer to freeze. The only real way to stop this is to force-quit BOTH <strong>flash.exe</strong> and <strong>iexplorer.exe</strong>. Some teachers may know enough to do this, but might accidentally close <strong>explorer.exe</strong instead, which will result in the disappearance of the task bar, start menu, and any open file explorer windows. The only solution for THIS is to reboot.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>3. Promote your Account</h2>
<p>Want to be an administrator? No biggie. Open up Notepad. Type in the following:</p>
<code>net localgroup administrators USERNAME /add</code>
<p>Although, you have to replace USERNAME with whatever your username is. Save the file as <strong>n00b.bat</strong> or as anything else .bat and NOT .txt. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and double-click it to run it. Once that's done, log out, then log back in again. You're now an admin for that specific machine!</p>
<p>Note: This may or may not work if they have disabled the command prompt. If they have, sorry folks, but you're out of luck for this one. You can still become an admin by using various software if you're really desperate.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>4. Do Something Neat with the ScrollLock Key</h2>
<p>It's usually useless... UNTIL NOW! Note: This only works on XP machines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start > Run. Type in "regedit" and click "OK".</li>
<li>Go to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt\Parameters</strong> by using the dropdowns in the sidebar.</li>
<li>Edit > New > DWORD Value. Set the name to <strong>CrashOnCtrlScroll</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click on this newly created value and click on Modify</li>
<li>Enter the number 1 in the Value data field and click on OK.</li>
<li>Close regedit and reboot your system.</li>
<li>Now you can blue screen (crash) your system by holding the right CTRL key and pressing "Scroll Lock" twice.</li></ol>
<p>It's bluescreeneriffic!</p>
<p></p>
<h2>5. Write a Virus that Doesn't Do Anything but Scares Your Friends</h2>
<p>Open notepad. Type this:</p>
<code>@echo off
echo OMFG YOU GOT A VIRUS.
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
echo It will now begin to delete your files.
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
echo Do you want to abort the deletion of your files?
pause
echo Wow you really fell for that. Pressing a key made the virus delete your account.
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
echo deleting.......
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
pathping localhost -q 2 -p 250 > nul
echo YOU'VE BEEN FOOLED. THERE IS NO VIRUS. YOU'RE JUST A N00B.
pause</code>
<p>Save this as <strong>cool_game.bat</strong> or anything else that ends in .bat and sounds like it's NOT a virus. This way, you can give a friend the file, and make them run it and then scare them silly. It's pretty entertaining.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>Seriously, don't do these if someone is watching. They may be fun, but it's easy for someone to monitor your account. If they catch you, well, then you're screwed.</p>
<p>On that light note, see you all next week!</p>
<p>&lt;/david&gt;</p>
