We just got back from Waterloo, where we won gold for both animation and construction and won bronze in video production!

<span id="more-473"></span>

Recently, the Glashan Tech Team went on their annual trip to Waterloo, Ontario to participate in the Skills Canada competition in Conestoga College. We brought our animation team, robotics team, construction team, and video team, and as usual, totally owned the competition. :D


<h2>Getting There</h2>

To go from Ottawa to Waterloo by Greyhound bus took us a total of seven hours, excluding the time we took when we stopped for lunch.


That's a freakin' long bus ride, so we took the opportunity to finish our homework, watch Avatar on the tiny televisions the bus provided, play on portable gaming systems, and drain out the batteries of our iPods.

We listened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelldansen" target="_blank">Carameldansen</a> a <em>lot. </em>We did the dance. Hao enjoyed it, even though he may later deny that he liked it. (We also did the dance as our victory dance when we won stuff, although I'll talk about that later.)

Ms. Roberts also kindly gave us a large pack of Sudokus which, no matter how hard we tried, we could not solve (except for Andrej, of course. He solved them easily.)


<h2>The Teams</h2>

I figured I'd talk about the <strong>Animation Team</strong> first as that's the one I was in.


So, what did the animation team have to do for their challenge? We had to make a movie about the line "I lost my way." Now, there are two ways to interpret this.

There is the literal way, where presumably a character would get lost somewhere. This is what <em>almost </em>every group did - a character gets lost in the woods and then finds their way again.

But not us. We took it slightly more metaphorically. Our movie was about an honours student who, after receiving a bad mark, turns to alcohol to relieve his problems. From here his life deteriorates, he robs a liquor store and goes to jail, and gets liver disease. AND GUESS WHAT??? We won first, with an astounding 100% final score! <a href="http://www.davepagurek.com/2010/what-could-have-been" target="_blank">Watch the video now!</a>

Also, our pals from the Ottawa Catholic School Board came in third. They sat across from us, and when we were animating, they had to endure our loud and incessant antics about Justin Bieber, Zach, and whatever else we found ridiculously funny at the time.

<strong>...and the other teams:</strong><strong> </strong>

I wasn't in any of the ones other than animation, so my account of the goings-on will not be as detailed for the rest of the teams. Anyway, here goes a brief summary.

CONSTRUCTION: From what I heard, their challenge came as a big surprise. They had to throw lego NXT parts into their build, and those are usually reserved for lego robotics, and not lego construction. Yet still, they made the "Baller Bot" (and made a rap song about it) and claimed forst prize!

ROBOTICS: Their wheel pieces decided to act up on them. They would turn normally when they were not plugged in. Once plugged in, they would not turn, even if the power was off. Nothing else changed. So when it came time to actually test the robot, it didn't work. Luckily, the rest of their project (poster, etc) made up for their loss and they did not completely fail because of the wheels. They narrowly missed being awarded a medal.

VIDEO: The challenge was to make a film about the Skills Canada competition. I'm pretty sure they do this every year, or at least for a few years, because last year they had the same challenge. Anyway, I watched their video but at the time I couldn't hear their sound because the room we were in was packed with screaming Justin Bieber fans and other kids, so the noise was drowned out. But from what I saw, they did a pretty good job. After all, how can it be a bad video when they interview Zach and I? :D ...so anyway, they got bronze!
<h2>Celebration</h2>
We went to a Greek restaurant afterwards. It had some pretty awesome food, and really good desserts as well. Sadly, Zach couldn't sample any dessert because of the 14 sugar packets and one artificial sweetener packet that he consumed. But either way, it was pretty awesome.

Then we went back to the hotel room and went mini golfing/bowling. I suck at mini golf, but I'm worse at bowling. But then again, so was everyone, which made it all the better! :D


<h2>...and back again.</h2>
Now we're back, and the Tech Team is planning to make a movie for the Ottawa Animation Festival (which is international by the way... hint, hint, JPB...) That means not too much will be new for a while. But hey, we need at least a week to show off our medals and use it as an excuse why we couldn't do <em>too</em> much work on the bus on the way back ;)

&lt;/david&gt;
