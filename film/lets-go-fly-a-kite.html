"So will you use credit as usual, or will you use cash this time?"
"I'll stick with credit... because I'm afraid of CHANGE!!! :O"

So this started as a test for my frame-by-frame animation skills. You can tell I didn't do that method for the whole movie, but you can tell I sort of tried to. Key word being "sort of", because a fair amount is animated in twos rather than every frame (so it's about an average of 18 fps even though it's technically at 24.) The excessive textures are a strategy I've been using lately to get away with applying a lot less effort than it would initially seem. It takes surprisingly little to achieve this effect, but it looks pretty :P

Also, Sari legitly helped write this. I'm training her.

And yes, my dad is really like that in public. It's embarrassing.
