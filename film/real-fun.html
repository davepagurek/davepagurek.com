So we were in Vancouver for the Skills Canada national 2D animation competition, having gone through the qualifying and provincial rounds. This time we were given a short audio clip and had to animate exactly that audio clip, unlike the last time when we were given a day to make a movie that included the audio clip. So, if you've ever heard of the 11 Second Club, it's sort of like that.

Anyway, this is what we made, and it came second!
