A guy doesn't realize there's an alien invasion until he's actually abducted.

This video was made by Luka and me for the qualifying round of the Skills Canada Ontario 2D Character Animation competition. We came in first, so we will be competing in the provincial level soon.

The prompt we were given was "it was never going to be an ordinary day." We had an hour when we needed to make character model sheets and storyboards. We were not allowed to touch the computers during that time. Then, once the hour was up, we had four more hours to create the actual animation. We were not being judged on sound, and it wouldn't have made sense to spend time doing sound editing, so this video is silent.
