So this was another movie made in a week, although I didn't do nearly as much work on it each day as I did for Masquerade. This one went by quickly because I got all the audio recorded on the first day, and then there wasn't a whole lot of actual animation to do for the rest of it. Also, I have like no homework. It's weird.

Anyway Sari was mad that I made the parts that she supposedly draws look too "stupid." Oops. She just wants me to write that she can actually draw better than that, just so no one's confused :P
