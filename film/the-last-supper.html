This is the animation Luka and I made for the Skills Canada regional competition. We were given the audio clip you hear and five hours to make an animation 20-25 seconds long, and this is what we came up with! It came second, but that's fine because we're going to the next round anyway.

I animated the scene where the door is opened and the kid rushes in, as well as the scene with sound.
