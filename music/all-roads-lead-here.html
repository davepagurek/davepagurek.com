<p><em>All Roads Lead Here</em> is a collection of songs made from September 2011 until March 2012. There is no central theme tying the songs together like there was in previous albums. This is mainly because my musical preferences changed since  started making this, which is evident as the album goes on. The unity of the songs is because of the gradual style progression.</p>
<p>It is available for free on my Bandcamp page.<p>
