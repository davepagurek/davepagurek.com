This is a talk I gave at <a href="https://ccfest.rocks/virtualccfest" target="_blank">Virtual CC Fest</a> earlier in March! In it, I live code my way through a little sketching app in Javascript and p5.js. This is not so secretly an attempt to make WebGL seem less scary by using its features to solve some useful problems in 2D sketches (don't worry! there's no 3D in this!) We'll go through how you can make smooth lines with changing thickness using some geometry processing, and how to add texture and animation with shaders. 

If you want to get some help or just want to chat about creative coding, consider <a href="https://discord.gg/sfV6ggFHu5">joining the p5 discord!</a>
