Walking through an art gallery, there is a lot of universally appreciated art. This is the sort of art that can be appreciated for its aesthetic value or technical skill: one can spend time examining and taking in the details in the lighting and shadows and form. It is not hard to look at it and understand why it deserves to be in a gallery.

But then, there is the modern art section of the gallery. This is the section with <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/3698">canvases painted entirely black</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)">signed urinals</a>. This is where one can find the art that makes people cry, "my kid could do this!" The common reply is that, well, your kid _didn't_ do it, but that isn't a satisfying answer for most. Doing something first is notable, sure, but is that isn't the only thing that makes a work worth the high value placed upon it by the gallery and society at large.

I believe the reason these works are notable is because they play an essential part in the formation of ideas in society. If you look at them in a broader context, it becomes more apparent what ideas were introduced in the work and how influential those ideas were.

## Where ideas come from

It's hard to trace the origin of ideas on an individual scale, but on a larger scale, patterns emerge. Although it is usually used to describe discourse between people, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic">Hegelian dialectic method</a> applies well here. The progression of an idea can be broken up into three phases. Initially, there is a **thesis**: the conventional way of thinking. Then, an **antithesis** is presented: a challenge to the status quo, taking a contrarian view to the logical extreme. Then, the idea settles into a **synthesis**, which takes ideas from the previous two phases and brings them together in novel ways.

A key part of this model of discourse is that it is *necessary* to follow new views all the way to conclusions before taking a step back and incorporating lessons learned into the mainstream. This is the role modern art often takes. It wasn't just that they were being different for the sake of being different; they were different because that is necessary for progress. The works weren't weird for the sake of being weird; they were weird because they needed to take a new idea as far as they could to see where it could be taken.

So, to fully appreciate a piece of modern art, it helps to look at what things were like beforehand, what new idea the work was trying to explore, and then how the core ideas got reinterpreted and incorporated into new work.

## Departure from realism

One clear example of the dialectic method in action was a clear movement away from realism. Throughout much of history, paintings were used to document prestigious families through portraiture. But by the 1800s, usage of cameras became more and more mainstream, and it wasn't as useful to have artists paint realistically, since the camera could accomplish the same thing.
