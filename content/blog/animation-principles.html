For decades, animators have been teaching the 12 Principles of Animation, a framework to help animators learn how to make convincing character motion. While intended for character animation, the 12 Principles can help us with the motion of more abstract graphical elements too, and avoid our motion graphics becoming "Powerpointy."

In this talk, I go through the 12 principles from the perspective of motion graphics sketching with live-coded examples.
