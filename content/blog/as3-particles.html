I'm working on a particle engine for Actionscript 3, to be used in either animations or games. I haven't gotten it fully ready to release the code (it's still pretty messy) but I do have some neat demos! 

Firstly, there's the standard use for particles: Smoke, explosions, etc.

Check back later for when I put up the code!
