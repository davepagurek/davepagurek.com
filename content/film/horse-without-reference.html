This is a project I've been working on for a lot longer than you'd think. It started with me just asking my friends to draw me horses without a reference because the results are always really funny. Eventually, that turned into <a href="https://davepagurek.github.io/horse-drawings/">a directory of horse drawings</a> (that <a href="https://github.com/davepagurek/horse-drawings">you can add your own horse to</a>, if you're familiar with using GitHub!)

We have these monthly meetups in Toronto for artist-coder types, and a few months ago the idea was floated that this could be the subject of an animated movie. It'd be pretty easy to animate because none<sup>[1]</sup> of the horses would look correct, and with that low bar, it would also be a fun opportunity to collaborate with my friends. In the spirit of creative code, the physics simulation scenes are actually outputs from <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2301226">an interactive sketch that you can try out</a> -- see how your own horse drawing holds up when pelted with dodgeballs! And also the reflective 3D horse ~40s in was done by a friend entirely in code in a shader in 1hr(!!!)

<sup>[1]</sup>for that one scene that breaks this rule, I animated it in 3D first and then rotoscoped it. I still cannot draw horses.

Anyway, over the course of this project, I have become the Horse Friend for people. I suffer this fate for you, dear reader. I hope it was worth it.
