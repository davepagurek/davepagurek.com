You don't have to be human to be ruined forever.

...so this took me about two and a half months to make, and as a result has made me more pissed at Flash than ever. I only used Flash rather than Toon Boom this time because of Flash's support for Photoshop layer to Flash layer conversion. But Flash, as it turns out, has trouble exporting anything over 16000 or something frames, which this movie exceeds, while keeping audio and video in sync (as well as even exporting anything at all!)

But it's done now, so... I hope you like it!
