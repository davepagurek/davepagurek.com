This is a short little horror (I guess?) animation based on a thing that actually happened to me as a kid. Minus the exaggerated flashing lights, my computer speakers picked up some radio from what sounded like a pilot (maybe a plane? maybe a helicopter, since we lived near a hospital with a helipad?) and I lost some sleep. Over the years it's also picked up what I think is the radio signal of a cell phone trying to send a text message (a dotted-eighth-sixteeth repeating static blip.)
