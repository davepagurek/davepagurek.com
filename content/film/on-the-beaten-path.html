So a few videos, we <a href="%root%/film/wall-of-words/">made a video</a> at the qualifying Ontario animation competition in Kingston, and we won, so we went to Waterloo for provincials, and guess what?

WE WON AT THE PROVINCIALS WITH THIS VIDEO! The topic was "Where am I?", and while other groups had lots of people waking up in strange places and having unoriginal adventures, this is what we came up with. We had 5hrs to do it, and even though we were supposed to get a sound library, we didn't, so we made the music in that time too.

Pause the video in the office scenes, go into fullscreen and HD, and try to read all the stuff on the signs :D
