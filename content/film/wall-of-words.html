This was the video that Luka and I made for the 2011 qualifying 2D Animation competition of Ontario. We won, by the way, and we'll be going to Waterloo in a few weeks for provincials :D

<strong>Update, May 4th:</strong> We won in Waterloo as well! <a href="%root%/exhibition/on-the-beaten-path/">See our winning video from provincials!</a>
