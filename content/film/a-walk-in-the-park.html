This is Luka and my entry in the 2011 Skills Canada national competition in Quebec City! We're representing Ontario here, and the theme was "Clowning Around." Tomorrow we find out how we placed!

EDIT: We came third in Canada! And since we're just grade nines, and we have another three years to compete, I think we'll have lots of time to improve our skills and come back stronger :)
