A warning: This has some violence in it, but due to the style of the drawings, it's not that graphic. Just thought I'd warn you.

This one isn't a comedy like usual. Hopefully this one will be a bit easier to understand than my last "serious" movie.

So this took about 9 days in total (including music and such.) It's not that long (about 2 and a half minutes), so it's not exactly my most ambitious project or anything like that. It is a much different style than I'm used to, but you'll find out soon why it has to be like that.
