Although I'm still not doing NATA this year because of being too busy, some scheduling stuff happened and it turns out I will be going to the Skills Canada animation competition this year. Now, I'm really out of practice, so I need to shape up a little. Over the next little while I'll probably be releasing a few quick, uncomplicated little practice animations like this one.

The music is mine, and the sounds are from freesound.org
