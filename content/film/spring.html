I wanted to capture the feeling of this situation I inevitably end up in always (and I'm pretty sure other people do too.) It's where you've been working with your head down for so long that you neglect to notice the seasons change, so when you finally look up, it seems sudden and different.

...and I finally had enough time and motivation to make something like this for the first time since high school! I wanted to make essentially just a quick vignette so that I could be sure I'd be able to finish it in a weekend without committing too much time.
