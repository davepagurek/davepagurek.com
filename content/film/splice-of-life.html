This was made for the open round of the Newgrounds Annual Tournament of Animation. The theme was "discovery of time travel."

This is the first time I've participated in anything like this, so I ended up working like crazy in case I didn't finish in time. It turns out, after spending pretty much all my free time working and temporarily forgetting about having a social life, I got it done right on time. See, I'm actually leaving to go to Waterloo for the Skills Ontario 2D animation competition soon, where I will only have access to a computer while I'm working on my animation for that competition, so I wouldn't be able to work on my NATA entry. My entry is done now, though, so I no longer need to worry about that.
As for the theme, I didn't want to do a typical time travel story, so I interpreted the theme a little differently. I recalled that scene from Back to the Future 2 where Doc draws a graph showing multiple timelines for Marty. I took this idea where, rather than moving along the forwards/backwards axis (x), I would move along the timelines axis (y), or in the case of this video, squish them all together into one timeline using a package that was supposed to be delivered to the mad scientist next door. It's a stretch in terms of adherence to the theme, but I think it still works.

Anyway, it looks like NATA's going to be a blast this year. I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone's entries!
