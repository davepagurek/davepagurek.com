I'm uploading this now because I can tell already that I won't have enough time to make any edits to it in the next week before the NATA deadline anyway due to excessive schoolwork, so I might as well get it over with and publish.

So this is a video about a girl who is shutting herself out from the rest of the world and struggles to deal with it. Although on the surface this may appear a little more depressing than things I've made before, like for example, "Until It's Gone" from last year's NATA, this time, rather than having some unfortunate situation descend upon the character and that's it, the character actually acts and fights back.

Also, in case you're interested, here's a time lapse of me making a scene of this video.
