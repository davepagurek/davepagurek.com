The Ontario Government is trying to strip out bike lanes we just got finished building and is adding lots of red tape to the process of adding new bike lanes. I got annoyed enough that I wrote, recorded, and animated this thing in a week. Go call Doug Ford!!

## Lyrics

<p>
I been fighting for my life when I go down town
<br />
I barely get to move before I slow down 
<br />
but I'm looking to the left and I am looking to the right
<br />
and then I see a rusty bicycle fly on by
</p>

<p>
palms are sweating up as I grip the wheel
<br />
I'm seething, I'm seething, I'm feeling, I feel,
<br />
that why can't it be me who picks who's getting all the rights to have that
<br />
extra lane of traffic that is going to the bikes?
</p>

<p>
When the price of gas is soaring and it hits an all time high
<br />
I blame it on the bicycles, I blame it on the bike
<br />
the parking for my truck is just a little bit too tight
<br />
I blame it on the bicycles, I blame it on the bike
</p>

<p>
when the city builds a building and it's twenty stories high
<br />
I blame it on the bicycles, I blame it on the bike then 
<br />
when I'm about to turn but kids are crossing on the side you know
<br />
I know that they'd be gone if we weren't lied to by the bike 
</p>

<p>
when my doctor is retiring and the others all have lines
<br />
I blame it on the bicycle, I blame it on the bike
<br />
when my team gives up a goal and then we lose in overtime
<br />
the goalie's aunt's a cyclist, I will swear upon my life!
</p>

<p>
when I find out that my neighbor has been sleeping with my wife
<br />
I blame it on the bicycles, I blame it on the bike
<br />
when I lose ten grand in crypto when I used one sketchy site it's cuz
<br />
the bicycles are sentient, they'll infiltrate my life! 
</p>

<p>
the voices sounds like bike bells and those crosswalk crossing signs and so
<br />
I drove down all the subway stairs cuz traffic lights have eyes but then
<br />
I snorted truck stop diesel to escape and get me high and now
<br />
the molecules are bicycles and DNA is bikes
</p>

<p>
the bicycles surround me, my vision, its just bikes
<br />
my senses, my senses, my senses, are bikes
<br />
my fingers are pedals, my spokes, my thighs,
<br />
I blame it on the bicycles, I blame it on the bike
</p>
