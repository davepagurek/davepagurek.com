This past month has been incredibly stressful. I have had a rather large attack on my website, which is now down until further notice, and I worked at a job all day on weekdays. The result is that this video is possibly more rushed to completion than any other one I've made. The animation quality is below my personal standards and I feel like I should have edited the music some more, but I will unfortunately be out of town for a little while now, and to be honest I just want to have a break. I'd like to say that I'll come back and fix things up later, but in reality I know I won't. I don't know how this round of NATA will turn out, but I wish everyone the best of luck.
As far as the plot goes, I always sort of wanted to make something where the protagonist finds himself in what is basically the position of a god, and then breaks under the pressure. I also decided to mix in another idea I had which involved having the world contained inside itself, so that there would be an infinite string of identical worlds inside each other where a change in one affects all of the others because they are the same world. IT is from that concept that I tried to tie in this round's theme, "the butterfly effect", and also where I got the title "macrocosm" from. I still feel that there's a lot more I could have done with the concept, especially given the rushed quality of this entry, so maybe I'll revisit the ideas later or something.
I'd just like to give thanks to my friend Laura who helped play some of the music to save me some time, and once again, I need to thank Bing for his awesome music, which you can download at highfivespaceship.bandcamp.com.
