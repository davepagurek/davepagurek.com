This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "chemistry."

I did a bit of math to place atoms into a regular cylindrical configuration and align beams between them. However, to make the tube go off seemingly into infinity would require too many objects to run smoothly, so I fake perspective a bit by turning the tube into a bit of a cone. However, I gave up on getting the math right for the beams in cone form (it worked perfecly in a cylinder, I swear!) so I added blur to make it harder to notice the inconsistencies.
