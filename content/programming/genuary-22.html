This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 22: "Make something that will look completely different in a year."

Rather than making something that uses the current date as input, I chose to make something that is chaotic enough that there's no way to accurately predict what it will look like in a year! I read the series <em>The Three Body Problem</em> last summer so the idea of inhabiting a planet orbiting three stars was on my mind. I made a simulation of what that might look like, from the perspective of someone on the planet.
