Grow your upstart Shawarma restauraunt into a local business juggernaut! You are the little green Shawarma shop, and your rivals, Shawerma Plus, Lazeez, and Shawarma Royale, are also present in the city of Waterloo, Ontario. It is up to you to effectively hire employees, price your shawarma, and relocate your store so that you can monopolize the local shawarma market.

Made for Terriblehack XI with Anna, Luka, and Marcus.
