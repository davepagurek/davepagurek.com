This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "dada."

I had a 3D scan of Raph lying around from a previous week. I used it to make a collage, but by taking clippings of the 3D model (by slicing it a few times and grabbing a chunk.) I added some print-style rendering to the model to unify the style a bit more.
