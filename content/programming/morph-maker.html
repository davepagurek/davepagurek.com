This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "nodes." I had previously made some morphs for other sketches using a mesh warp, which uses nodes in the mesh representation. I thought I'd illustrate how those sketches work by making a morph tool.

Here's what it looks like in action:
