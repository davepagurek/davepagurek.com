We created a webapp to make simple programs on your phone, designed to be a completely different experience than traditional languages, which were made without phones in mind.

Rather than typing commands, add operations to the pipeline. The pipeline is like a stack: to add two numbers, first add two values to the stack, then add the `Add` function, and then an Apply block to run the last function. The stack will then collapse into the sum!

Arrays can be made with `Value -> Value -> Range -> Apply` to make an array of numbers from the low to the high value. Arrays can be mapped, too. To increment every element by one, you would do: `Value -> Value -> Range -> Apply -> Value(1) -> Add -> Map -> Apply`
