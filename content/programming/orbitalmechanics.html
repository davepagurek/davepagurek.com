OrbitalMechanics is a planetary physics simulator written in Actionscript 3.

Basically, it is an application of various parts of the Grade 12 physics curriculum. Gravitational force is calculated using the formula F = (G * m<sub>1</sub> * m<sub>2</sub>)/(d<sup>2</sup>), where G is the arbitrary number 100, masses are in arbitrrary units where mass = 1 is comparable to a small asteroid, and distance is measured in Flash units. When two bodies collide (when the distance between them is less than the sum of their radii), they are replaced with a single body with their combined mass. The resulting body's velocity is found assuming it is a perfectly inelastic collision using the formula m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub> = (m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>)v'.

I chose to program this in Actionscript 3 because although Flash as a web medium is on the decline, I still believe that Actionscript 3 is a real pleasure to work with. Actionscript has a vector graphics library, which in itself is an improvement over HTML5 canvas. All the language-related issues I had with AS2 were, in my opinion, fixed in AS3. It's object-oriented and event-based, and larger projects are much more manageable. It's great, and since I was really only making OrbitalMechanics for fun, I decided not to worry about using more future-proof technology.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Calculates gravitational force</li>
	<li>Simulates inelastic collisions</li>
	<li>Provides example UI</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>
Here is an example body with an initial velocity being added to the system:
<code lang="actionscript">
var system:OrbitalMechanics = new OrbitalMechanics();
system.addBody(new Body(0, 50, 3, new Geovector(6, Math.PI)));
system.x = 0;
system.y = 0;
stage.addChild(system);
