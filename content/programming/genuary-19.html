This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 19: "Use text/typography."

This is a remix of my sketch for <a href="%root%/programming/genuary-16">Genuary 16</a>, which simulates paint dripping into more paint. I've swapped out the paint drops for letters, and made the base look more like tomato soup.
