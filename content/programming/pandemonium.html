Modern panorama apps are better at accurately reproducing their subjects, and subsequently forget their true goal: surprising the user with the unexpected and uncanny. We propose a novel camera system that maximizes occurrences of weird visuals rather than trying to sweep them under the rug.",

Who doesn't want to see their cat have eight legs? Panoramas used to provide a steady source of delight as subjects inevitably move while the panorama is being captured. We refer to these glitches as *jank.* While jank still occurs in the capture phase of modern panorama apps, the final image disappointingly removes most jank.

App makers have lost sight of their true goal: producing images that inspire a sense of biblical awe. Like how paintings got weird and embraced the surreal and abstract once photographs became common, panoramas too need to get weird now that it's easy to capture reality.

We aim to fill this niche. First, we explore what used to produce panorama jank. We then design a new camera system optimized for jank. Finally, we evaluate this system by exploring its effectiveness at producing surprising results in the hands of users.
