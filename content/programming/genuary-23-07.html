This a sketch for Genuary, day 7: "sample a colour palette from your favourite movie/album cover."

Here's a generative remake of Will Butler's album <em>Generations.</em> I deviated from the prompt here as I have copied the cover wholesale rather than just the palette, and also while I quite like this album, it is neither my favourite album nor my favourite album art. But it seemed like a good project! It's basically a fancy flow field to make a fingerprint.
