This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "hyperspace."

I wanted to capture the feeling if looking down the length of a subway and seeing the world whoosh by you through the windows. Interestingly, p5 limits you to 5 lights at a time, so each subway car is rendered with only 4 lights (5 would be asymmetrical), and only with its own 4 lights, so there's a little lighting discontinuity between each car.
