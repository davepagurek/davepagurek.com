This a sketch for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme this week was "improbable architecture."

I just saw The Boy and the Heron, which includes some precariously
stacked blocks like this, so now I'm recreating it through code!

The stacks are made via a simple generating grammar that does no collision detection.

The blocks themselves are made using Evan Wallace's csg.js, but with a wrapper to be able to do booleans with p5.Geometry inputs. It's barely used in this sketch, but I've wanted to be able to do that for a while, expect more soon!
