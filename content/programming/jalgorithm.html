For years, society has been plagued by the lack of a conclusive answer to the question of how arbitrary things would wear jeans, if they wore jeans. This paper proposes a jalgorithm to determine the mathematically optimal configuration of pants on a silhouette, leveraging recent insights in the fields of computer vision and differentiable rendering.

This is based off of the <a href="https://github.com/BachiLi/diffvg">diffvg differential vector graphics renderer</a>. It uses a customized loss function to optimize the vertices of pants, based on the following rules:

<ol>
<li>**Duality of man:** Pants should bisect the silhouette of the wearer through its center, covering half its area.</li>
<li>**No-stretch jeans:** Pants, when applied to the wearer in rest position, should not be so deformed that they no longer resemble prototypical jeans.</li>
<li>**(Topologically) torn jean avoidance:** Limbs should only go through the open ends of pants, and similarly, closed ends of pants should not intersect limbs.</li>
<li>**Dress code compliance:** Pants should be on the body of the wearer, not off of it.</li>
</ol>

You really shouldn't look at the code for this as I wrote it at 1am really quickly and hackily, but if you really want to, it's in `apps/pants.py` on GitHub.
