This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. We were given the theme "cut" and this is what I came up with!

If you cut a convex shape along a plane, you get two convex shapes. Therefore, if you start with a convex shape as input (and a cube is one such shape), one can keep recursively the results of previous cuts. Using this approach, I cut a cube a number of times, make the pieces explode outwards, and then slurp back into itself to reform the cube.
