This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 17: "3 colors."

Rapha&euml;l de Courville spent the first few days of Genuary <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph/status/1477350832291074050">playfully</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph/status/1477601837863821313">misinterpreting</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph/status/1477986298346766336">the</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph/status/1478725113105293312">prompts</a>, and I wanted to do the same for this one. The prompt asks for three colours, and on a computer screen, <em>every</em> colour is actually made of some combination of red, green, and blue. So I could submit an empty white canvas and it would still count!

However, I couldn't let myself submit a literally blank canvas. To over-explain my joke, I wrote a shader that zooms in on pretend pixels to show that white is actually made up of red, green, and blue subpixels. A high-effort shitpost.
