This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 31: "Negative space."

I learned recently about the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness" target="_blank">crown shyness</a>, where tree leaves stop just short of touching the leaves of other trees. I wanted to recreate something like that.

This works by dividing the canvas into Voronoi cells, and then growing branching structures within each cell.
