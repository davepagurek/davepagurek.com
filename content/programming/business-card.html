This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "cards." I've always wanted to make a business card like the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/">business card raytracer</a> where the code to generate the card fits on the card itself.

This is the code:

The result looks like this:

Here's an expanded, commented version of the code to see what it's actually doing. It uses a Fourier decomposition of the text to encode it as numbers, samples the Fourier curves into line segments, and then (very slowly on the CPU) renders a signed distance field of those segments:

```js
// Some constants for width/height. Originally I was going to do
// 350x200, but doing an sdf without a shader is slow so I'm using
// half the side lengths and embracing the pixely look.
W=175;
H=100;

// The number 255 is used enough that it saves characters to assign it
// to a single-letter variable and reuse that.
F=255;

// The next two arrays contain the Fourier coefficients of curves that draw,
// respectively, the cursive "Dave" and the cursive "p5." They're represented
// as imaginary numbers, so coefficients are read in twos: real and imaginary
// parts. Each array is also actually two arrays concatenated: the
// coefficients for the x axis and then the coefficients for the y axis.
