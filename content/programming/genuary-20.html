This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 20: "Make a sea of shapes."

This one generates a number of triangles on a plane that slowly distort over time. I copy those same triangles, offset and scaled, to another, lower plane, and connect the edges from the upper and lower triangles with quads. These connecting faces are drawn without depth testing, using an additive blend mode.
