This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was Matrix, given that a trailer for The Matrix: Ressurections recently dropped. Here is my tribute to The Matrix!

## Rendering

Like a few other <a href="%root%/programming/gehryisms">recent sketches</a>, this sketch uses sphere mapping for reflections. In a fragment shader, this maps the normal at each point on a surface to a point on a 2D image, which will be used for the reflected content.

## Deforming a 3D object and keeping normals intact

In August, I embarked on a surprisingly long and involved journey towards deformation of models while keeping normals intact. If you are interested in the juicy details, <a href="%root%/blog/realtime-deformation/">I wrote a long post about why this is necessary and the math and software engineering required to work around it.</a> The result of that work is a library, <a href="https://github.com/davepagurek/glsl-autodiff">glsl-autodiff</a>, which lets me write deformation code in a shader and not break the <a href="%root%/programming/gehryisms">reflection fragment shader I've been using.</a>

So, using that libarry, I wrote some code to bend a spoon that I whipped up in Blender!
