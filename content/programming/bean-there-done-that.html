Chicago's status as a world-class city is cemented by its iconic bean sculpture. Other cities, wanting to replicate the success, have muddied the bean waters by introducing their own bean variations: New York City has a bean sharing similar properties, and Ottawa has a sphere, dubbed the "Ottawa bean" by locals. Our economic analysis proves their worth, so naturally other cities will want their own. We present a mathematical model of the space of all bean sculptures, and an algorithm to help cities replace existing landmarks with beans.
