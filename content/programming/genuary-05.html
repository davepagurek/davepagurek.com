This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 5: "Destroy a square."

This starts with a plane, and then bends and twists it in a vertex shader using my <a href="%root%/programming/glsl-autodiff/">glsl-autodiff</a> library to update the normals to be able to use a reflective material.
