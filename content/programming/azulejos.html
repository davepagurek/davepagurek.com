This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "azulejos." Earlier this week, David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss published a preprint of a paper about an aperiodic monotile, and Craig <a href="https://github.com/isohedral/hatviz">open-sourced some p5 code for drawing and tiling the monotile.</a> I tried combining the tile with the azulejos aesthetic for the week.

This uses Framebuffers to cache the sub-tiles that make up the larger super-tiles, and also to make the feedback effect in the background.
