This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "Raphaël de Courville, Processing Community Lead Fellow."

Raphaël's own community voted to make his name + new job title the theme of the week. I saw on Twitter that someone got a 3D scan of him, so I asked him for it so that I could use it in a sketch, and miraculously, he obliged. We know he publicly is opposed to the Mondrian colour scheme, but we all know that secretly, in the sanctity of his own mind, he loves it.
