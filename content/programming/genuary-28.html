This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 28: "Self portrait."

This is maybe my favourite sketch from Genuary.

The technique is one I've used a few times before. I morph between two drawings, where there's an equivalent stroke in the second drawing for each stroke in the first drawing. To do the morph, I calculate a number of points along regular intervals of each stroke. By sampling the same number of points on both strokes, I can generate an in-between stroke by linearly interpolating each sample point, and then drawing a line connecting all the interpolated points. Add some easing, and offset the transition of different strokes, and you get a pretty compelling animation!
