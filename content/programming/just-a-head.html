So this one was made for Jane for christmas. It uses the webcam to control the movement so don't bother playing this if you don't actually own a webcam. Make sure you plug it in and then agree to the Flash Player security warning (don't worry, I'm not doing anything malicious with the webcam.)

Anyway, move around to adjust the parallax perspective of the objects on the screen to try to get them to connect.
