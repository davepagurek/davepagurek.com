Version control for HUMANS. Make sense of all the copies of copies of files on your desktop!

## Installation

```
npm install -g @davepagurek/file-fantasy
```

## Usage

`commit` a file to make a backup of it.

```
$ ff commit something.txt
something.txt was copied to something_Copy(2).txt
```

`branch` a file to make a separate version of it. No need to come up with a branch name, we do that for you!

```
$ ff branch something.txt
file: something.txt | newish file: spmfthiog.txt
something.txt was copied to spmfthiog.txt
```

`merge` a source branch into a destination branch (and shove the contents of both together.)

```
$ ff merge spmfthiog.txt something_Copy\(2\).txt
ðŸ¤¯ Merged to create: something_Copy(3)-spmfthiog.txt
```

Create a `log` of all the complex version history so you can understand where all those files came from.
