This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "Kandinsky."

I chose to focus on a particular aspect of Kandinsky's work to focus on: the squiggly lines. This doesn't try to replicate that, but rather uses it as a jumping off point. Squiggles are formed by a combination of noise and lissajous curves, drawn with variable stroke thickness, and animated in over time. Paint splotches in the background are warped SDFs for smooth-unioned circles.
