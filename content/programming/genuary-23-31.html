This a sketch for Genuary, day 31: "deliberately break one of your previous images."

<iframe class="sketch" src="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1816687/embed/" width="700" height="700"></iframe>

So this is the code from <a href="%root%/content/programming/genuary-23-19">the previous Animorphs sketch</a>, but with random alignment of points on the contour of one image with the other to produce some much more jank morphs.
