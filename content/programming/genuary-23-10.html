This is a sketch for Genuary, day 10: "generative music."

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpYBhX0UH04">Terry Riley's piece <em>In C</em></a> consists of a bunch of small passages, and each instrument in the orchestra plays through them in sequence, but can repeat each passage as many times as they like before continuing on. The result is an ever shifting series of chords and textures. I tried to make something similar, on a much smaller scale, with some Tone.js instruments playing through a series of much simpler patterns.
