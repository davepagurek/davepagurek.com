This a sketch for Genuary, day 7: "something youâ€™ve always wanted to learn."

A while ago I saw the <a href="https://github.com/LingDong-/p5-hershey-js">p5.hershey</a> library, which draws text made out of lines as opposed to outlines (the way the font this text is set in is rendered.) I wanted to use it to vary the thickness of the line to see what would happen, like having calligraphy with changing pen pressure.
