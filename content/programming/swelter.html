This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "melting."

This one is a lot more technically complicated than it needs to be. The models are made from <strong>signed distance functions</strong>, which <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/">Inigo Quilez has the definitive resource on</a>, converted to p5.Geometry via the Marching Cubes algorithm, which was adapted from some code written by my friend <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~amadan/">Abhishek Madan</a> for our University of Waterloo Engineering capstone project. It then uses <a href="https://github.com/davepagurek/glsl-autodiff">glsl-autodiff</a> to make the model shimmer and melt.
