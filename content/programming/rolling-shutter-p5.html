This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "that sketch you never got around to finishing."

This uses slit scanning to time-offset each row of pixels on the screen. <a href="%root%/programming/rolling-shutter">I made an earlier version of this in openFrameworks</a>, but it isn't as sharable as a web-based sketch, and there are noticeable discontinuities between rows from differnt frames. To adapt this one for web, I'm using 120-something framebuffers instead of p5.Graphics for performance, and using a shader to blend between rows.
