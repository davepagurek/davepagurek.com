This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "origami."

This isn't super related to the theme: I had originally intended to use a physics simulation to unfold 3D meshes into a nice looking net, but that didn't turn out super well. It did, however, still look kinda interesting. This combines 3D text extrusion from a <a href="%root%/programming/3d-text">previous sketch</a> and the ambient occlusion shader in <a href="https://github.com/davepagurek/p5.Framebuffer/">p5.Framebuffer</a>.
