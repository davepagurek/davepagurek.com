This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 9: "Architecture."

This is a remastering of <a href="%root%/programming/frontier3d">a Processing java sketch from 2016</a> that generated archipelagos with little houses on them. I quite like the output of that algorithm and was proud of the output when I first made it. Six years later, I brought it back to life again by converting the code to p5.js so that it could run in the browser. I also added programmed camera movement and depth-of-field blur powered by a shader and the depth map of a <a href="https://github.com/davepagurek/p5.Framebuffer/">p5.Framebuffer</a>.
