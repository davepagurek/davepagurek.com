This a sketch for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme this week was "refreaction."

This is another experiment with Shader Park. The pigeon is a character drawn via a Shader Park SDF, using smooth unions between shapes. The bottle and its refraction shader are done in p5. Some wallpapers were generated from this for the <a href="https://donorbox.org/to-the-power-of-10">Processing Decade of Code fundraiser.</a>
