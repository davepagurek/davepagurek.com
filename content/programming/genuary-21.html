This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 21: "Combine two (or more) of your pieces from previous days to make a new piece."

For this, I combined the base model from <a href="%root%/programming/genuary-08">Genuary 8, "single curve,"</a> and added a modified version of the distortion shader in <a href="%root%/programming/genuary-05">Genuary 5, "destroy a square."</a> I had to lose my appetite and now you do too!
