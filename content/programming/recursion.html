This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "recursion."

This draws hands on fingers recursively, using <a href="%root%/programming/glsl-autodiff">glsl-autodiff</a> to make them wiggle via a shader. To blend the seams between the models, I've disabled depth testing, and fade out each hand at the wrists for a smoother transition.
