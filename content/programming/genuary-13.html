This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 13: "#800x80."

The #800x80 hashtag on twitter is pretty interesting. The odd aspect ratio encourages some unique compositions. I generate some little hills and make a running guy go over them.
