This is part of a longer-term project to abstract away the complicated handshakes you have to do to create OpenGL shaders and ferry information to, from, and between them. In order to get a better idea of what is involved in this project, we spent some time writing vanilla GLSL. Here's what we accomplished:

- Multiple variable point lights
- Point light shadows
- Shadow blur
- Phong shading
- Smooth shading
- Perlin noise
- Movable camera
