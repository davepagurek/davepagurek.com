This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was movie title sequences, so I decided to recreate the titles for the Kubric classic *2001: A Space Odyssey* in a shader.

There's nothing groundbreaking in this shader, but it combines a few things:

- A linear gradient function, which is used (along with hand-picked colour stops) to create the glare around the sun
- Per-pixel noise, used to create stars and the land for the planet
- An approximation of Lambertian diffuse shading to create the shading for the planet
- Simple additive light around the edge of the planet (based on the distance to the edge) to simulate atmosphere
