This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 7: "Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing."

This is a digital interpretation of Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawing 821a:

<div class="row"><blockquote>
  A white square divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts, each with a different direction of alternating flat and glossy bands.
</blockquote></div>

The line pattern is generated and then used as a texture map controlling the shininess coefficient of a plane's material. I've also added a bump map to perturb the normals and make it look a little more like a gallery wall.
