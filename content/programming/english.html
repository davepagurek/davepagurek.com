This is a small demo of a <a href="https://github.com/davepagurek/English">Perl 6 English parsing module I wrote.</a> It matches words against a limited dictionary of parts of speech, and fits the tokens to a context-free grammar. You can <a href="%root%/blog/demystifying-english-parsing/">read about how it works on my blog.</a>

It currently has support for:
- Simple sentences (noun phrase followed by verb phrase)
- Compound sentences (independent clauses separated by "and")

In progress:
- Imperative sentences
- Infinitives and verbs as nouns
- Nouns as adjectives
- Commas
