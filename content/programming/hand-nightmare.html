This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "don't touch," so I took that as an opportunity to make some more cursed hands. I cut out bits of photos of my fingers and stuck them in a generative recursive structure and made them move.
