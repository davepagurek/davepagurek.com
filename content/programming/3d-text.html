This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "ASCII."

A while ago I tried doing something in OpenFrameworks where I built a model out of extruded text. Knowing I wanted to do some more things like this in the future, I tried recreating the same text extrusion algorithm in p5. It involved copy-and-pasting the existing `textToPoints` code and making some slight modifications to be able to actually discern which points are on which contour, but it works!

This also uses <a href="https://github.com/davepagurek/p5.Framebuffer/">p5.Framebuffer</a> to create a feedback texture using floating point colors, allowing for a smoother fade out to white without the visual bugs you get when using integer colors for this.
