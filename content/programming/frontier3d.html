This is inspired by <a href="%root%/programming/frontier">an earlier project of mine</a> to generate 2D landscapes procedurally. I needed album art for <a href="https://soundcloud.com/davidpvm/archipelago">a track I was working on</a>, and wanted to bring landscape generation into the third dimension.

Perlin noise is used to create the landscape, which is then tesselated using a Delaunay algorithm. Trees then grow on surfaces that aren't inclined too much. Houses spawn (on stilts if need be), with extensions climbing upwards.
