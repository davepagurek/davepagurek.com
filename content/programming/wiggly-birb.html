This is an entry for <a href="https://twitter.com/sableRaph">@sableRaph</a>'s weekly creative coding challenge. The theme for this week was "wiggly."

This uses a function I'm sure I'll reuse at some point to draw a "teardrop": two circles of differing radii, connected with straight line segments into a drop shape. The body-tail and head-body connections of the bird are each a teardrop. I also set up a simple two-joint inverse kinematics system for the legs.
