This is a sketch for <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary 2022</a>, which provides a creative coding prompt for each day of January. This is day 29: "Isometric perspective."

This ended up looking this way a little by accident. I was going to use my blur shader again like usual, but it was looking a little buggy (the depth calculation isn't made for isometric perspective.) I visualized the depth buffer, and found that it looked pretty cool on its own. It looks like the objects are disappearing into a fog. By playing around with the colour levels and adding dithering, it ended up looking a bit like the album art for <em>Modern Vampires of The City</em> by Vampire Weekend.
