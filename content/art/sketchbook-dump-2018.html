While I didn't sit down and make many complete pieces in 2018, I brought my sketchbook with me everywhere, and managed to draw a lot anyway.

## Co-op at Cruise, San Francisco, January-April

I took up the habit of sketching regularly this term, and also got the other co-op student on my team on board.

## 4A Term at the University of Waterloo, May-July

In this term, a friend of mine and I thought up weekly drawing prompts to motivate each other to keep drawing throughout the term. Between that and sending postcards to friends, this fuelled most of my summer drawing.

## Co-op at Figma, San Francisco, August-December

Turns out I was busy with work, my fourth year design project, and grad school applications, so I manage to draw *zero things!*

## Winter Break, Ottawa, December

With work finished and friends around, a few last pieces materialized at the end of the year.
